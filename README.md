## Data Analysis at Extreme ##

The Dax Toolkit is an open source C++ header only library that provides a collection of data analysis and visualization algorithms that run well on multi- and many-core processors.  The Dax Toolkit also makes it easy to design other visualization algorithms that work well on such processors. We currently support CUDA, OpenMP, Intel TBB, and Serial Execution.

### How ###

The Dax Toolkit uses fine-grained concurrency for data analysis and visualization algorithms.
The basic computational unit of the Dax Toolkit is a worklet, a function that implements the algorithmâ€™s behavior on an element of a mesh (that is, a point, edge, face, or cell) or a small local neighborhood.

The worklet is constrained to be serial and stateless; it can access only the element passed to and from the invocation. With this constraint, the serial worklet function can be concurrently executed on an unlimited number of threads without the complications of threads or race conditions.

Although worklets are not allowed communication, many visualization algorithms require operations such as variable array packing and coincident topology resolution that intrinsically require significant coordination among threads. Dax enables such algorithms by classifying and implementing the most common and versatile communicative operations into worklet types which are managed by the Dax dispatcher.

### Why ###


The Dax Toolkit simplifies the development of parallel visualization algorithms. Consider the computation of gradients using finite differences. Because the Dax Toolkit is structured such that it can execute worklets on a GPU, we measure that it performs this operation over 100 times faster than VTK running on a single CPU. Furthermore, the Dax API can be switched to a different device by changing only a single line of code. Dax currently provides support for CUDA (GPU), OpenMP (multicore CPU), and serial execution.

``` cpp
struct CellGradient : public dax::exec::WorkletMapCell
{
  typedef void ControlSignature(Topology, Field(Point), Field(Point), Field(Out));
  typedef _4 ExecutionSignature(_1,_2,_3);

  template<class CellTag>
  DAX_EXEC_EXPORT
  dax::Vector3 operator()(
      CellTag cellTag,
      const dax::exec::CellField<dax::Vector3,CellTag> &coords,
      const dax::exec::CellField<dax::Scalar,CellTag> &pointField) const
  {
    dax::Vector3 parametricCellCenter =
        dax::exec::ParametricCoordinates<CellTag>::Center();

    return dax::exec::CellDerivative(parametricCellCenter,
                                     coords,
                                     pointField,
                                     cellTag);
  }
};

```
## Getting Dax ##


The Dax repository is located at [https://github.com/kitware/DaxToolkit](https://github.com/kitware/DaxToolkit)

Dax dependencies are:


+  [CMake 2.8.8](http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
+  [Boost 1.49.0](http://www.boost.org) or greater
+  [Cuda Toolkit 4+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) or [Thrust 1.4 / 1.5](https://thrust.github.com)
   depending if you want Cuda and/or OpenMP

```
git clone git://github.com/Kitware/DaxToolkit.git dax
mkdir dax-build
cd dax-build
cmake-gui ../dax
```

A detailed walk-through of installing and building Dax can be found on our [Install page](http://www.daxtoolkit.org/index.php/Building_the_Dax_Toolkit)

## Example ##


This basic worklet finds the magnitude of a vector

``` cpp
class Magnitude : public dax::exec::WorkletMapField
{
public:
  typedef void ControlSignature(Field(In), Field(Out));
  typedef void ExecutionSignature(_1,_2);

  DAX_EXEC_EXPORT void operator()(const dax::Vector3 &inValue,
                                  dax::Scalar &outValue) const
    { outValue = dax::math::Magnitude(inValue); }
};
```

And here is how to execute the worklet:

``` cpp

#include <dax/cont/ArrayHandle.h>
#include <dax/cont/DispatcherMapField.h>
#include <dax/cont/UniformGrid.h>

//construct a handle to store the results
dax::cont::ArrayHandle<dax::Scalar> magnitudeHandle;

//input grid of cubes 1,1,1 at origin 0,0,0 with extents 0,0,0 => 128,128,128
dax::cont::UniformGrid<> inputGrid;
inputGrid.SetExtent(dax::make_Id3(0), dax::make_Id3(127));

//construct and launch the magnitude worklet.
dax::cont::DispatcherMapField< dax::worklet::Magnitude > dispatcher;
dispatcher.Invoke(grid->GetPointCoordinates(),
                 magnitudeHandle);


```
